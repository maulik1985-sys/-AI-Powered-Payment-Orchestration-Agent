# Contributing to AI Payment Orchestration Agent

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This n8n workflow demonstrates AI-powered payment orchestration across multiple providers.

## 🧪 How to Test This Workflow

### Prerequisites
- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)
- OpenAI API key
- Stripe test account
- Razorpay account (for UPI testing)
- Open Banking API credentials (optional)

### Setup Steps
1. **Import the Workflow**
   - Download `ai-payment-agent-workflow.json`
   - In n8n, go to Workflows → Import from File
   - Select the downloaded JSON file

2. **Configure Credentials**
   - OpenAI: Add your API key in the OpenAI Model node
   - Stripe: Update the Authorization header in "Create Stripe Payment Intent" node
   - Razorpay: Update the MCP server URL in "UPI Payment (Razorpay)" node
   - Open Banking: Configure OAuth credentials if using Finicity/Plaid

3. **Set Up Webhooks**
   - Activate the workflow in n8n
   - Copy webhook URLs from:
     - `Webhook Trigger` node → for chatbot integration
     - `Stripe Payment Confirmation` → for Stripe webhooks
     - `Razorpay UPI Confirmation` → for Razorpay webhooks
   - Configure these URLs in your payment provider dashboards

4. **Test the Workflow**
   - Use the example requests in `examples/test-requests.md`
   - Send POST requests to the webhook URL
   - Monitor execution in n8n's workflow view

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs, please include:
- **n8n version** (e.g., 1.20.0)
- **Node that failed** (e.g., "Intent Parser", "Create Stripe Payment Intent")
- **Error message** (full error from n8n execution log)
- **Request payload** (sanitize any sensitive data)
- **Expected vs actual behavior**

### Example Issue Report
n8n Version: 1.20.0
Node: Create Stripe Payment Intent
Error: "Request failed with status code 401"
Payload: {"message": "pay $50 to John"}
Expected: Payment intent created
Actual: Authentication error

## 🔧 Code Style

This is a workflow configuration project, not a code repository. When suggesting changes:
- Explain the workflow logic clearly
- Provide before/after screenshots if modifying node structure
- Test thoroughly before submitting

## 📝 Documentation

If you improve the README or add documentation:
- Keep language clear and beginner-friendly
- Include screenshots for complex setups
- Update the architecture diagram if workflow structure changes

## 🤝 Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
